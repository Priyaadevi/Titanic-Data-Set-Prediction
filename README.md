# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Prediction
Using Machine Learning 

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset and builds machine learning models to predict passenger survival based on different features (age, sex, class, fare, etc.).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** on the Titanic dataset  
- Explore survival patterns across different features  
- Visualize important relationships and correlations  
- Train machine learning models to predict survival  
- Evaluate models using accuracy and classification metrics  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle â€“ Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
It includes the following columns:  

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger  
- **Survived**: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)  
- **Name**: Passenger name  
- **Sex**: Gender  
- **Age**: Age in years  
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard  
- **Ticket**: Ticket number  
- **Fare**: Passenger fare  
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available)  
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
